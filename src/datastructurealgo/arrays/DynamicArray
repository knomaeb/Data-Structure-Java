A dynamic array in Java refers to an array-like data structure that can grow or shrink in size dynamically, unlike regular arrays which have a fixed size. The most commonly used dynamic array in Java is implemented using the ArrayList class, part of the java.util package.

Key Features of Dynamic Arrays
    1. Resizable:
       -> The size of a dynamic array is automatically adjusted as elements are added or removed.
       -> You don't need to specify the size at creation.

    2. Efficient Growth:
       -> When the underlying array gets full, a new larger array is created internally, and all existing elements are copied to the new array.

    3. Ease of Use:
       -> Provides methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements efficiently.
