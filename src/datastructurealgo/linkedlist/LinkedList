A linked list is a data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers. Each node contains:

  1. Data: The value of the node.
  2. Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

   -> The key feature of a linked list is that the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. This makes it easy to insert and delete elements dynamically without reallocating or reordering existing elements.

Types of Linked Lists
  1. Singly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next node.
  2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the next and the previous node.
  3. Circular Linked List: The last node references back to the first node, forming a circle.
