Binary Search Concept in Java:
      -> Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a sorted array.
      -> It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half and determining whether the target value lies in the left or right half.
      -> This method has a time complexity of O(log n), making it faster than linear search for large datasets.

How Binary Search Works:
    1. Start with the middle element:
       - If the middle element matches the target, return its index.
       - If the target is smaller than the middle element, search the left half of the array.
       - If the target is larger, search the right half.
    2. Repeat the process until the element is found or the range becomes empty.
